bubblewrap 0.11.1
=================

Released: 2026-03-21

Bug fixes:

  * Reset disposition of `SIGCHLD`, restoring normal subprocess management
    if bwrap was run from a process that was ignoring that signal,
    such as Erlang or volumeicon (#705, Joel Pelaez Jorge)

  * Don't ignore `--userns 0`, `--userns2 0` or `--pidns 0` if used
    (#731, Daniel Cazares).
    Note that using a fd number ≥ 3 for these purposes is still
    preferred, to avoid confusion with the stdin, stdout, stderr
    that will be inherited by the command inside the container.

  * Fix grammar in an error message (#694, J. Neuschäfer)

  * Fix a broken link in the documentation (#729, Aaron Brooks)

Internal changes:

  * Enable user namespaces in Github Actions configuration, fixing a CI
    regression with newer Ubuntu (#728, Joel Pelaez Jorge)

  * Clarify comments (#737, Simon McVittie)

bubblewrap 0.11.0
=================

Released: 2024-10-30

Dependencies:

  * Remove the Autotools build system. Meson ≥ 0.49.0 is now required
    at build-time. (#625, Hugo Osvaldo Barrera)

  * For users of bash-completion, bash-completion ≥ 2.10 is recommended.
    With older bash-completion, bubblewrap might install completions
    outside its `${prefix}` unless overridden with `-Dbash_completion_dir=…`.

Enhancements:

  * New `--overlay`, `--tmp-overlay`, `--ro-overlay` and `--overlay-src`
    options allow creation of overlay mounts.
    This feature is not available when bubblewrap is installed setuid.
    (#412, #663; Ryan Hendrickson, William Manley, Simon McVittie)

  * New `--level-prefix` option produces output that can be parsed by
    tools like `logger --prio-prefix` and `systemd-cat --level-prefix=1`
    (#646, Simon McVittie)

Bug fixes:

  * Handle `EINTR` when doing I/O on files or sockets (#657, Simon McVittie)

  * Don't make assumptions about alignment of socket control message data
    (#637, Simon McVittie)

  * Silence some Meson deprecation warnings (#647, @Sertonix)

  * Update URLs in documentation to https (#566, @TotalCaesar659)

  * Improve tests' compatibility with busybox (#627, @Sertonix)

  * Improve compatibility with Meson < 1.3.0 (#664, Simon McVittie)

Internal changes:

  * Consistently use `<stdbool.h>` for booleans (#660, Simon McVittie)

  * Avoid `-Wshadow` compiler warnings (#661, Simon McVittie)

  * Update Github Actions configuration (#658, Simon McVittie)
